# :angry: Software Development Repository

This is a repository to learn Git basics because we are a bunch of noobs :).

_This is an italic sentence duhhh._

**This sentence is bolder than you are.**

## Second heading bruh
This is a list:
- I want to go home
- Please let me go home
- I'm going home

This README is written because i need to pass :cry:

This is a `code` example.

```py
print("this text is in python")
```

```java
System.out.println("Now it's in java.")
```

```ruby
puts "Ganti jadi rubi om";
```
